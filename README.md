👋 Hi, I’m @mizurieb.
🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of web development. I want to learn a lot! 😄 
⚡ Before starting with this, I have gained experience in marketing, as a community manager and also as a writer. I want to do something different.
💞️ I’m using a lot of my time to learn, but I also like to watch movies and shows, or to scroll on Twitter! Find me there as @mabescript.
