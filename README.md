👋 Hi, I’m @mizurieb
🌱 I’m currently learning the basics to create webpages and hopefully lean on the programming side of life. I want to learn a lot! 😄 
⚡ Before starting with this, I have gained experience in marketing, as a community manager and also as a writer. I'm looking to a fresh start in my life.
💞️ I’m using most of my time to learn, but as a current hobby I like to play Marvel Snap or watch a movie.
